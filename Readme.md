## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pshar10/DigitalSignalProcessing.git
   cd DigitalSignalProcessing
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use `pip` to install the required packages.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Data Preparation**:
   - Place your raw signal data in the `data/` directory or use provided scripts in `src/` to load and preprocess data.

## Usage

### Running DSP Scripts
To execute the main DSP workflow, run:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Jupyter Notebooks
Explore the `notebooks/` directory for interactive notebooks that demonstrate signal processing techniques, including filtering and transformations.

## Key Modules

- **Filtering**: Scripts for applying high-pass, low-pass, and band-pass filters on signal data.
- **Transformations**: Implementations of Fourier Transform, Laplace Transform, and other techniques for analyzing signal frequency and time domains.
- **Utilities**: Helper functions for signal loading, noise reduction, and plotting.
